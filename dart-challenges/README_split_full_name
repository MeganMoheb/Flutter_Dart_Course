# ðŸ§© Dart Problem: Split Full Name

## ðŸ“‹ Description

This simple Dart program takes a **full name** input from the user (e.g., `"Megan Moheb Attia"`) and **prints each part** (first, middle, last) on a separate line.


## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. Prompts the user to enter their full name.
2. Uses the `.split(' ')` method to divide the name into parts based on spaces.
3. Prints each name part on a separate line using a `for` loop.



### âœ… Example:
**input:**

Enter your full name: Megan Moheb Attia

**Output:**

Megan
Moheb
Attia
