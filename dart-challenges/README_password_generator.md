This command-line tool allows the user to choose a desired password strength, then generates a random password accordingly. The password includes a mix of:

1. The program asks the user to choose a password strength:  
   `weak`, `medium`, or `strong`.
2. Based on the choice:
   - `weak` â†’ 5 characters
   - `medium` â†’ 10 characters
   - `strong` â†’ 16 characters
3. A random password is generated using characters from a predefined set.
